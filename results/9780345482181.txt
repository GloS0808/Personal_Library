[Richard] Hawke\u2019s dialogue is sharp and snappy and the plot moves with all the energy of New York City.\u201d\u2014Cleveland Plain Dealer A child of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and the bastard son of a beloved former police commissioner, Fritz Malone is all too familiar with New York City\u2019s rougher side. So when a gunman opens fire at the crowded Thanksgiving Day parade, Fritz steps into action, giving chase. He then learns that someone dubbed \u201cNightmare\u201d has been taunting the city\u2019s leaders for weeks\u2014and there\u2019s more carnage to come, unless the city meets the madman\u2019s impossible demands. The nervous police need an outside man, and Fritz fits the bill. Racing furiously against time, Fritz finds himself confounded by Nightmare\u2019s multiple masks and messengers. But the dark story behind the story soon begins to emerge, and when Fritz zeroes in on the terrible truth, the killer retaliates by making things personal. Now Fritz must grapple with his deepest fear: Sometimes nightmares really do come true.
