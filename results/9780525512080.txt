It\u2019s locked at all times. Because when the trunk opens, people around Adelaide start to disappear. The year is 1915, and Adelaide is in trouble. Her secret sin killed her parents, forcing her to flee California in a hellfire rush and make her way to Montana as a homesteader. Dragging the trunk with her at every stop, she will become one of the \u201clone women\u201d taking advantage of the government\u2019s offer of free land for those who can tame it\u2014except that Adelaide isn\u2019t alone.

Crafted by a modern master of magical suspense, Lone Women blends shimmering prose, an unforgettable cast of adventurers who find horror and sisterhood in a brutal landscape, and a portrait of early-twentieth-century America like you\u2019ve never seen. And at its heart is the gripping story of a woman desperate to bury her past\u2014or redeem it.",
