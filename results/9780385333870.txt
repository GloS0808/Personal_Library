Vonnegut is a postmodern Mark Twain.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review Gal\u00e1pagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race.
